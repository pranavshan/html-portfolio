<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  <h3>Intoducing Myself :</h3>
  
  Hi there, my name is Pranav Shandilya! I'm always curious and love learning
  new things. Helping others brings me a lot of joy, and I'm lucky to have some
  amazing friends who I enjoy spending time with. When it comes to any task, I
  always give 100% effort to make sure it's done right.

  <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
  If I tell you about my hobbies, it would be exploring different natural
  places. I fell in love with Wayanad and hope to visit more. I also enjoy
  eating, sleeping and repeating.

  <h3>College Life:</h3>
  
  My college life is enriched by my best friends who I enjoy spending time with,
  watching movies, and exploring the city. However, some of them are lazy and
  prefer to rest. Although ECE is the toughest branch in my college, I am
  currently studying it, and even though it's just my second year, it has
  already challenged my patience.
